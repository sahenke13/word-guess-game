Homework 3 - Word Guess

This is a wild west themed word guess game created and maintained by Steven Henke.

Just press a key to start playing.  All words are derived from Country Western themed flims, specifically but not limited to Tombstone.

After 5 missed guesses, you will be assesed a lose and the page will refresh and a new turn awaits.

Maybe this time, you will be quicker of the "word" draw!!!
